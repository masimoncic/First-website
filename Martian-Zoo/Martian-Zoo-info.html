        <h2 class='white'>Story</h2>
        <br>
        <p id='story'>The human population on Mars has been steadily growing over the last few 
            decades, and terraforming is underway.  But Mars is now undergoing a planet-wide food
            shortage. In response, an emergency relief shuttle full of 
            food supplies has been sent from Earth.  But it will take 10 days to arrive on Mars.

            You have just recently opened a small zoo, with the help of a kind-hearted Martian
            beast whom you befriended.  The Martian requires huge quantities of food every day,
            and unfortunately it is not attracting enough attention to your zoo to keep up with 
            the rapidly increasing food prices.  To save your new best friend, you must expand your 
            zoo enough to keep up with food expenses until the relief shuttle arrives.
        </p>

        <h2>How to play</h2>
        <p>The goal of the game is to keep the Martian alive for 10 days.  To do this, you will need
            to make enough money to buy food.  Every animal you buy will increase your income.  To buy 
            an animal, you first need a habitat for it to live in.  For each animal, you will see how many 
            you currently own, and how many you have housing for.  For example, you start with no housing for 
            tigers, so you will see "Number of Tigers: 0/0".  To increase the maximum number of animals you can 
            have, click "Expand Housing".  After buying housing for tigers, you will see "Number of Tigers: 0/4".
            That means you can buy 4 tigers before needing to expand your housing again.  
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also increase the quality of your housing.  This will give a large boost to the amount of income
            you get for animals of that type, as well as a very small boost to the income you get from everything 
            else in your zoo.  
        </p>
        <p>The Martian isn't the only animal that needs food.  The more animals you buy, the more food you will
            need to keep everything alive.  Each animal has a food guage that shows how well fed they are, from 
            0 to 100.  To feed your animal, press the button below its food guage.  If the food guage reaches 0,
            the animal will die and you will no longer recieve income from it.  If the martian dies, its game over.
        </p>
        <h2>Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Food prices go up every day at midngiht.</li>
                <li>
                    Different animals require different amounts of food to feed once.  The amount needed is shown
                    on the feed button.
                </li>
                <li>Chimpanzees and Tigers offer large increases to income at low cost, so they will give 
                    your economy a big boost in the early stages of the game.  However, they also consume a lot 
                    of food, which can make them a liability later on in the game.  Penguins and Pandas have very 
                    high initial costs to buy relative to the income they give, but they require very little food.  
                    Alligators and Elephants are the middle ground: they are not too expensive to buy,
                    but still give a high amount of income relative to the amount of food they consume.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Martian grows hungrier every day.  Everyday at midnight, its food consumption increases.
                    Additionally, on days 6 and 9 its hunger guage starts to decrease more rapidly, so it must be fed more often.
                </li>
                <li>You may have to make sacrifices for your favorite Martian.  As food costs rise, some
                    animals may not be worth as much as it takes to feed them.  If you are low on income,
                    you may have to choose which animals to feed.  Make sure you always have enough food
                    for the Martian!
                </li> 
                <li>
                    Whenever you buy housing for a type of animal for the first time, the variety of your zoo increases,
                    causing every animal in the zoo to generate more income.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The hungrier an animal is, the more filled they will be from food.  Wait until your animals are hungry to get the most value out of your food.
                </li>
                <li>Quality upgrades grant a multiplicative bonus to the income of all animals of one type.  This makes it a great 
                    way to increase your income without needing more food.
                </li>
            </ul>
